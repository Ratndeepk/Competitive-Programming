# Dynamic Programming 

* When a recursive solution solves same problem more than once - <b>Overlapping Subproblem</b>
* Achieving SSolution by solving subproblem - <b>Optimal Substructure</b>  
If above two conditions satifies in recursive solution we can apply DP.(Usually decreases Time Complexity)
### Two Approaches
* TopDown (Memorization)
* BottomUP (Tabular)

A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one 
(or some) starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously 
found ones. DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which assures a much faster running 
time than other techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc. [For More](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)
